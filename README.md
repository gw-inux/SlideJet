## üöÄ SlideJet

**SlideJet** is a lightweight tool that transforms PowerPoint presentations into interactive web apps using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io). It converts your slides into a slideshow, complete with speaker notes that can be translated in several languages. SlideJet also brings an option to convert the slideshow in a PDF file for further use like doing notes. **SlideJet** is an ideal tool for teaching, workshops, training materials, and documentation.

SlideJet consists of two components:

1. **SlideJet-Convert**: A Streamlit application that runs locally and converts PowerPoint presentations (including speaker notes) into web-ready graphics and note files.
2. **SlideJet-Present**: A Streamlit application to present the converted slides in a user-friendly web format. Presentations can be deployed online via platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud.
