## üöÄ SlideJet

**SlideJet** is a lightweight tool that transforms PowerPoint presentations into interactive web apps using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io). It converts your slides into a slideshow, complete with speaker notes that can be translated in several languages. SlideJet also brings an option to convert the slideshow in a PDF file for further use like doing notes. **SlideJet** is an ideal tool for teaching, workshops, training materials, and documentation.

SlideJet consists of two components:

1. **SlideJet-Convert**: A Streamlit application that runs locally and converts PowerPoint presentations (including speaker notes) into web-ready graphics and note files.
2. **SlideJet-Present**: A Streamlit application to present the converted slides in a user-friendly web format. Presentations can be deployed online via platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and running the app

If not already on your computer: Please install Python (e.g., through a distribution like Anaconda, or by downloading from www.python.org).

Download the Python files **SlideJet_convert.py** and **SlideJet_present_template.py** and the **requirements.txt** on a folder on your local computer.

Open a **Command Prompt** and move to the directory where your **SlideJet_convert.py** and **SlideJet_present_template.py** files are located.

Create a virtual Python environment for SlideJet:

```
bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment (Windows):

```
bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then start the app with the command window from the folder where SlideJet_convert.py is saved with:

```bash
streamlit run SlideJet_convert.py
```

### üì∫ Getting Started

A short tutorial and video guide (link coming soon) will walk you through the full process.
With a decent internet connection, the entire setup takes just a few minutes. Subsequent transfering of Powerpoint presentation in web applications is just a matter of seconds.

The Presentation [**SlideJet - Overview**](https://slidejet-outline.streamlit.app/) introduces the app and provide further guidance on use.
