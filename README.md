## üöÄ SlideJet

**SlideJet** is a lightweight tool that transforms PowerPoint presentations into beautiful, interactive web apps using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io). It converts your slides into scrollable or slideshow-style views ‚Äî complete with speaker notes ‚Äî making it easy to share presentations online.

SlideJet consists of two components:

1. **SlideJet-Convert**: A Streamlit application that runs locally and converts PowerPoint presentations (including speaker notes) into web-ready graphics and note files.
2. **SlideJet-Present**: A Streamlit application to present the converted slides in a user-friendly web format. Presentations can be deployed online via platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud.
